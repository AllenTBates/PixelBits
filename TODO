Remember about AGILE METHOD!
We needs to do thing iteratively.
Each person will get a task and finish that task before moving on.

To present:
*Group info: name, logo, (DONE) 
*Description about team name: PixelBits we decided on this name because pixels is the building
block of digital art while bits is the building block for computer. Hence the name PixelBits is
perfect because creating a game required artistic work and also programming logic in order to
have a fun and interactive game.
*Game ideas (DONE) - "BLOCKY"
*Game design issues (3D level design, over the shoulder camera)

Mission Statement:We were inspired by the Block Dude video game from the TI-83 Calculator. We wanted to make a spiritual
successor in the form of a 3D video game so that the new generation of gamers can enjoy the same game that this team did
back during our teenage years. 
Game Setting: The game setting will take place in Blockopolis, a world where the only way to progress is to get through 
doors. Unfortunately, the doors can only be reached by solving puzzles by using blocks.
Story synopsis: A block man is stuck in a block world. The only way he can escape is through the doors of dimension.
