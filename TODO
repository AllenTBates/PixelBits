Remember about AGILE METHOD!
We needs to do thing iteratively.
Each person will get a task and finish that task before moving on.

To present:
*Group info: name, logo, (DONE) 
*Description about team name: PixelBits we decided on this name because pixels is the building
block of digital art while bits is the building block for computer. Hence the name PixelBits is
perfect because creating a game required artistic work and also programming logic in order to
have a fun and interactive game.
*Game ideas (DONE) - "BLOCKY"
*Game design issues (3D level design, over the shoulder camera)
